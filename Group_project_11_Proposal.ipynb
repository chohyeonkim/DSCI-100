    "As digital payments boomed in recent years with the rapid development of the Internet, people enjoy the fast and convenient transaction service but also face an increasing number of cyber criminals alongside. The Data Breach Index announced that over five million records are being stolen on a daily basis, which indicates that fraud is very common in our daily life. However, detection of fraud is challenging since trillions of card transactions happen per day. \n"
